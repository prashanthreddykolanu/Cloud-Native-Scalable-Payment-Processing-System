Overview: This is a cloud-native, secure, scalable payment processing system to process seamless financial transactions efficiently. It is built using Spring Boot (Backend), React (Frontend), MySQL (Database), Docker, Kubernetes, and CI/CD Pipelines. OAuth2, JWT, and TLS encryption are used in the system to ensure security while processing payments. This architecture is designed using microservices principles, hence it is highly scalable and deployable in cloud environments like AWS, GCP, and Azure.

Features: The system facilitates secure payment processing through RESTful APIs, with seamless transactions. It boasts a microservices-based backend architecture deployed using Spring Boot and a React.js frontend for the user interface. MySQL is used to store transaction data, while OAuth2 and JWT authentication are employed for security. The system is fully Dockerized and Kubernetes-compatible, with simple deployment and scalability. A CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions automatically tests and deploys, and API documentation is available via Swagger for integration and testing.

Tech Stack: The frontend is built with React.js, TypeScript, Axios, and Tailwind CSS for styling. The backend is developed using Spring Boot, Java, Spring Security (OAuth2, JWT), JPA/Hibernate, and MySQL for database management. The DevOps and cloud deployment stack includes Docker, Kubernetes, Nginx Ingress, CI/CD (GitHub Actions), and cloud hosting on AWS, GCP, or Azure.

Getting Started:
To start using this system, clone the repository using:

sh
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/yourgithubusername/cloud-payment-system.git
cd cloud-payment-system
For backend setup, navigate to the backend directory, install dependencies using mvn clean install, and run the Spring Boot application with mvn spring-boot:run. The backend will be accessible at http://localhost:8080.

For frontend setup, navigate to the frontend directory, install dependencies with npm install, and start the React application with npm start. The frontend will be available at http://localhost:3000.

Docker Setup:
To simplify deployment, the system is Dockerized. You can build and run the entire project using Docker Compose:

sh
Copy
Edit
docker-compose up --build
This command will spin up the backend, frontend, and MySQL database in separate containers.

Kubernetes Deployment:
For cloud-native deployment, Kubernetes configurations are provided. To deploy the application in a Kubernetes cluster, apply the YAML configurations:

sh
Copy
Edit
kubectl apply -f k8s/backend-deployment.yaml
kubectl apply -f k8s/frontend-deployment.yaml
kubectl apply -f k8s/mysql-deployment.yaml
kubectl apply -f k8s/ingress.yaml
Once deployed, the application will be accessible through an Ingress Controller, which routes requests to the appropriate services.

API Endpoints:
The backend exposes several API endpoints for payment processing.
POST /api/payments/process â†’ Processes a payment and generates a transaction ID.
GET /api/payments/transactions â†’ Retrieves the list of processed transactions.
POST /auth/login â†’ Handles user authentication using OAuth2.

CI/CD Pipeline:
The system is integrated with GitHub Actions to automate the build, test, and deployment process. The CI/CD pipeline ensures smooth updates and deployments to cloud environments. The configuration can be found in .github/workflows/deploy.yml.

Cloud Deployment:
This system is designed for deployment on AWS, GCP, or Azure using Docker and Kubernetes. Load balancing, auto-scaling, and service discovery configurations ensure high availability and performance in production environments.
